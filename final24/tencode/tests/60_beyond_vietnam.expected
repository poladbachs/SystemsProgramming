Mr. Chairman, ladies  gentlemen:

Concerned About „. Á recent statements ƒ your executive

ª sensitive † its guidance, ‡ ” • deeply  need ƒ a ï way
Ï € darkness ‚ seems so close around ç.

Over € past two ğ, ¦ I ‹ moved † break € betrayal ƒ my
Ø silences  † œ  € burnings ƒ my Ø heart, ¦ I ‹
called ‡ radical departures  € destruction ƒ „, many
persons ‹ questioned me ´ € wisdom ƒ my path. At € heart
ƒ … concerns  query Ñ often loomed large  loud: "Why •
you Ğ ´ € ¶, Dr. King?" "Why • you joining € voices
ƒ dissent?" "Peace  civil rights don't mix," Š say. "Aren't you
hurting € cause ƒ your £," Š ask? Û ¨ I hear –,
though I often õ € source ƒ … concern, I am
nevertheless greatly saddened, ‡ Ó ¾ mean ‚ €
inquirers ‹ — really known me, my § or my
¸. Indeed, … ¾ suggest ‚ Š do — know €
™  › Š live.

In € light ƒ Ó ü misunderstanding, I deem Â ƒ signal
importance † try † state clearly,  I trust concisely, why I
believe ‚ € path  Dexter Avenue Baptist Church--€ church 
Montgomery, Alabama, where I began my pastorate--leads clearly † 
sanctuary æ.

I ñ †  platform æ † É a passionate plea † my
beloved Œ. · speech  — addressed † Hanoi or † €
ê ¥ ÿ. It  — addressed † China or †
Russia. Nor  Â an attempt † overlook € ambiguity ƒ € total
situation  € need ‡ a collective solution † € tragedy ƒ
„. Neither  Â an attempt † É ë „ or €
ê ¥ ÿ paragons ƒ virtue, nor † overlook € role
Š ‰ play  € successful resolution ƒ € problem. While Š
both may ‹ justifiable reasons † ª suspicious ƒ € good faith
ƒ € Ü ù, À  Ç give eloquent testimony † €
fact ‚ conflicts • Ö resolved © trustful give  take
Ò both sides.

Tonight, however, I wish — † œ “ Hanoi  € ê
¥ ÿ, ± rather † my fellow ş.

Since I am a preacher ö ¸, I suppose Â  — surprising ‚
I ‹ seven major reasons ‡ bringing „ ³ € field ƒ my
moral vision. There  at € outset a very obvious  almost facile
connection between € ¶  „  € ¹ I,  others,
‹ ¿ waging  . A few ğ ago ¤ ø a shining
moment  ‚ ¹. It seemed ¦ if ¤ ø a real promise ƒ
hope ‡ € ô--both black  white--å € poverty
program. There ° experiments, hopes, ï beginnings. Then came €
buildup  „,  I é  program broken  eviscerated,
¦ if Â ° some idle ½ plaything ƒ a society gone mad Ò
¶,  I knew ‚  Ì Ö invest € necessary funds or
energies  rehabilitation ƒ its ô so long ¦ adventures like
„ continued † draw Õ  skills  money like some demonic
destructive suction tube. So, I ø increasingly compelled † ÷ €
¶ ¦ an enemy ƒ € ô  † attack Â ¦ Ó.

Perhaps a à ü recognition ƒ Ë took place ¨ Â became
clear † me ‚ € ¶ ø doing far à ä devastating € hopes
ƒ € ô at home. It ø sending … sons  … í 
… husbands † fight  † die  extraordinarily high proportions
relative † € rest ƒ € population. ì ° taking € black young
Õ « had ¿ crippled ö ˆ society  sending – eight
thousand miles away † guarantee liberties  Southeast Asia ›
Š had — found  southwest Georgia  East Harlem. Û so ”
‹ ¿ repeatedly faced “ € cruel irony ƒ watching Negro 
white boys Ò TV screens ¦ Š kill  die together ‡ a Œ
‚ Ñ ¿ unable † seat – together  € same schools. Û so
” watch –  brutal solidarity burning € huts ƒ a ô village,
± ” realize ‚ Š Ì hardly live Ò € same block 
Chicago. I could — ª silent  € face ƒ Ó cruel manipulation
ƒ € ô.

My third reason moves † an even deeper level ƒ awareness, ‡ Â
grows out ƒ my experience  € ghettoes ƒ € ë over € last
three ğ--Æ € last three summers. As I ‹ walked among
€ desperate, rejected,  angry young Õ, I ‹ told – ‚
Molotov cocktails  rifles Ì — solve … problems. I ‹
tried † offer – my deepest Å while maintaining my
conviction ‚ social change comes most meaningfully å
nonviolent Î. But Š ask-- rightly so--what ´ „?
® ask if ˆ Ø Œ wasn't using massive doses ƒ ¢ †
solve its problems, † bring ´ € changes Â wanted. Their
¾ hit home,  I knew ‚ I could Ö again raise my voice
š € ¢ ƒ € oppressed  € ghettos © having
first spoken clearly † € greatest purveyor ƒ ¢  € ™
today--my Ø ‘. For € sake ƒ ¯ boys, ‡ € sake ƒ
 ‘, ‡ € sake ƒ € hundreds ƒ thousands trembling
under ˆ ¢, I cannot ª silent.

For ¯ « ask € question, "Aren't you a civil rights leader?"
 thereby mean † exclude me  € movement ‡ Ê, I ‹
 further answer. In 1957 ¨ a group ƒ ç formed € Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, ” chose ¦ ˆ motto: "To save €
soul ƒ ." ì ° convinced ‚ ” could — limit ˆ vision
† certain rights ‡ black £, ± instead affirmed €
conviction ‚  Ì Ö ª free or saved  itself until
€ descendants ƒ its slaves ° loosed completely  € shackles
Š still wear. In a way ” ° agreeing “ Langston Hughes, ‚
black bard ƒ Harlem, « had written earlier:

    O, yes,
    I say Â plain,
     Ö ø  † me,
    Û yet I swear  oath--
     ’ ª!

Now, Â should ª incandescently clear ‚ no á « Ñ any concern
‡ € integrity  À ƒ  today can ignore € present
¶. If 's soul becomes totally poisoned, part ƒ € autopsy
‰ read: „. It can Ö ª saved so long ¦ Â destroys €
deepest hopes ƒ Õ € ™ over. So Â  ‚ ¯ ƒ ç « •
yet determined ‚  ’ ª--•--• led down € path ƒ
protest  dissent, working ‡ € health ƒ ˆ È.

As if € weight ƒ Ó a § † € À  health ƒ
 ° — enough, another burden ƒ responsibility ø placed
upon me  1954;  I cannot forget ‚ € Nobel Peace Prize ø
also a commission, a commission † work harder ä I had ever worked
before ‡ "€ İ ƒ man." ·  a ¸ ‚ takes me
Ï national allegiances, ± even if Â ° — present I Ì
yet ‹ † live “ € meaning ƒ my § † € ministry ƒ
Jesus Christ. To me € relationship ƒ  ministry † € making ƒ
Ê  so obvious ‚ I sometimes marvel at ¯ « ask me why
I'm Ğ š € ¶. Could Â ª ‚ Š do — know ‚
€ good news ø meant ‡ Ã Õ--‡ Communist  capitalist, ‡
… ¬  ours, ‡ black  ‡ white, ‡  
 conservative? Have Š forgotten ‚ my ministry   obedience
† € One « loved his enemies so fully ‚ he died ‡ –? What
then can I say † € Vietcong or † Castro or † Mao ¦ a faithful
minister ƒ  One? Can I threaten – “ death or ‰ I —
share “ – my À?

Û finally, ¦ I try † explain ‡ you  ‡ myself € road ‚
leads  Montgomery †  place I Ì ‹ offered Ã ‚ ø
most valid if I simply said ‚ I ‰ ª true † my conviction ‚
I share “ Ã Õ € ¸ † ª a son ƒ € living God. Beyond
€ ¸ ƒ race or Œ or creed   vocation ƒ sonship 
İ,  because I believe ‚ € Father  deeply º
Æ ‡ his suffering  helpless  outcast ¬, I ñ
